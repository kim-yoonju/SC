## 1. Environment Setup 🔧

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Note:** Different models require specific transformers versions:
- Qwen2-7B-Instruct & Qwen2.5-Math-7B SFT: transformers 4.39.3
- Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct SFT: transformers 4.44.3
- RL: transformers 4.46.3

## 2. Data Collection 📚
Download the original [[MATH500](https://github.com/openai/prm800k/tree/main/prm800k/math_splits)] and [[GSM8K](https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math)] dataset.
#### Serve the model with vLLM
```
python -m vllm.entrypoints.api_server  --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-Math-7B --port 8081  --tensor-parallel-size 4
```
Configure the model and data path in `./scripts/collect_data.sh`
```
sh ./scripts/collect_data.sh
```
We also provide the SFT and RL data in `data/train_data/sft_qwen2.5_math_7B.json` and `data/train_data/rl_data_qwen2.5.jsonl` for reproducing the result of Qwen2.5-Math-7B in our paper.

We also support using our datasets via [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/S2R-data/S2R-dataset) now! 


## 3. SFT Training 🔥
cd ./code/scripts
Configure your data and model path, then run:

```
sh ./code/scripts/train_sft.sh
```

## 4. Online RL Training 🚀 

Configure your data and model path, then run:
```
sh ./code/scripts/train_rl.sh
```

Use the following config for outcome-level training:
```
--use_instance_level True
--kl_coef 0.01   # for Qwen2.5-Math_7B
--rl_data_path ./data/train_data/rl_data_qwen2.5.jsonl  # for Qwen2.5-Math_7B
```

Use the following config for process-level training:
```
--use_instance_level False
--kl_coef 0.05
--rl_data_path ./data/train_data/rl_data_qwen2.5.jsonl  # for Qwen2.5-Math_7B
```

## 5. Offline RL Training 💼

### Rejection Sampling and Prompt Filtering

For offline sampling rollouts, run the following script to specify the prompt dataset (including problem and answer), the model path, and the storage path:
```shell
sh ./sample/sample_all.sh
```

The format of the prompt dataset should follow the reference:
`./data/train_data/rl_data_offline.jsonl`


Configure your data path, then run for rejection sampling and prompt filtering:
```shell
sh ./scripts/process_offline_trainset.sh
```

### Training Script
Configure your data and model path, then run:
```shell
sh ./scripts/train_offline_rl.sh
```
